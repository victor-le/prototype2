      <p class="mt-2">Heat is known for assisting whenever we are suffering from muscle tension and pain.
        This is the same when incorporating hot stones with a massage.
        The muscles are able to "melt" more quickly, thus we are able to penetrate the underlying issues more effectively.
        Also promotes relaxation, reduces anxiety, and improves sleep.</p>
